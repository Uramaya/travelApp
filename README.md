## About
This is the travel itinerary app helps users plan and organize their trips with simple UI and google map interface. It allows users to create detailed day-by-day itineraries, manage bookings(developing), explore destinations that other users shared. With features image update , map integration, and personalized recommendations(developing), the app ensures a smooth and enjoyable travel experience.

## Why Travel Itinerary App
I love traveling and exploring the world, and I often use third-party itinerary apps. However, when I shared a 14-day Europe itinerary with a friend, they found it difficult to read. I realized the app cluttered too much information on one page, making it hard to find key details like destinations and times. This experience inspired me to create an app with a simpler, more intuitive UI/UX, allowing users to navigate their itineraries more smoothly and efficiently.


## Project Enviromnet

### Nginx
A reverse proxy server
If you access into 80 port, the nginx connects to a node server that serves a next.js application.
And, if you access into 3000 port, the nginx connects to a php-fpm server that serves a laravel application.
### node
**React.js Next.js**  
A node.js server
It works to serve a next.js application and manage npm package modules.
If you want to deploy a next.js application or install required npm modules, you should enter this container to do those.
### php-fpm
**Laravel**  
A php fastcgi server
It works to serve a laravel application and composer modules.
If you want to do anything for laravel or install composer modules, you should enter this container to do those.
### mysql
A mysql server
It is connected from php-fpm container to manage application data.
It is mounted on mysql-data volumes not to be destory application data along with this container.
Of course, you can view application data from mysql client throw the port opended for local access.
